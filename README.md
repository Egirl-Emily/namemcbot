# ü§ñ NameMC Discord.js Bot
This is a basic Discord.js bot utilizing the [MojangJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mojangjs), [HypixelJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hypixeljs) & [NameMC](https://namemc.com) APIs for information on Minecraft users, including basic moderation such as modmail, avatar, and whois. Initially crafted for the NameMC Discord server, this is now being made open source by Bea#0001.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Getting Started
**Requirements & Setup:**
1. A Discord Bot Application **[(Register Here)](https://discord.com/developers/applications)** <br/>

2. Obtain a Hypixel API key by joining `mc.hypixel.net` with a valid Minecraft account and running the /api command. You will then be assigned a unique key that is to remain private. You should put it in your .env (an example is in this repository.) <br/>

3. Create a new application on [Discord](https://discord.com/developers/applications) like so:

4. Give it a name!

5. When you have completed, you should see a page application like below. You‚Äôll see information like a client ID, but that's not what we need.

6. Create your bot user by navigating to the bot section and hitting Add Bot.

7. Once your bot has been created, you should see a page like below. Make sure to hit COPY and store this copied selection somewhere safe, because once someone has that, destruction of a server/your bot can easily be caused. This is called your bot token.

8. Add your bot to a test server in Discord. You can do this by redirecting yourself in [The Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) by clicking Oauth2. Select bot, then give it Administrator permissions. If you make it public, I highly discourge keeping the Administrator perms. Then, copy the link it gives you. The link should look like the one below, `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=748716618267492423&permissions=8&scope=bot`

9. Go through all the code, and change the prefixes everywhere. If you're feeling lazy, just search the entire project for `n?` which is the pre-set prefix and replaceall with the one you want. If you're new to coding, I suggest trying [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), a code editor which works amazingly for Discord bot development in JavaScript. <br/>

10. **EDIT YOUR ENV.** This is the most important step because you put your token and API key here. Replace the file name `.env.example` with `.env` for it to work properly, then replace `TOKEN=YOURTOKENHERE` with your token. Make sure to also replace `HYPIXELAPI_KEY=YOURAPIKEYHERE` with your key generated in step 2. <br/>

11. **Install all the fancy npm packages!** This is also a fun step. Go into your terminal directory to your bot wherever it's being hosted and type `npm i`. This auto installs the packages this bot relies on!  <br/>

12. To run: `node index.js`
  - After that, console should start spitting out a table and a green ready message.
  - If it works, you should be able to run your bot's help command in your server! <br/>
  <br/>

## üñá Hosting
If you want to host this bot without having to re-run it locally on your computer and restarting it every time you shut it down, I suggest the following:

<br/>

**VPS:** <br/>
[Heroku, for private bots:](https://heroku.com)<br/>This has free hosting, and runs for the entire month if you link a valid debit/credit card too! This is how I host my public bot, [Amour](https://amourbot.com) (On a professional dyno.) <br/>
<br/>
[DigitalOcean, a VPS company:](https://m.do.co/c/aecdbe57ea38)<br/>This is also a good solution, with a range of operating systems such as Ubuntu, which is a personal favorite (: <br/>
<br/>
[Glitch:](https://glitch.com/)<br/>This is a simple yet effective host, especially for plain bots like this. Put your token in and you're off. Just make sure your project is private, or people can steal your tokens! <br/>
<br/>
[Repl.it:](https://repl.it/)<br/>This site can grab your GitHub repository with ease if you clone this one and edit it to your liking, and it has been efficient for me in the past when working on small bots for friends.
